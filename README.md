# ðŸ“¦ Supply Chain Data Visualisation & Forecasting Tool

An internal analytics tool designed to track product availability trends, forecast demand using time series models, and alert managers to low-stock products â€” all powered by Python and Excel dashboards.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

Retail operations often suffer from stockouts or overstocking due to inaccurate demand forecasting and lack of real-time inventory insights. This project solves that problem by:

- Forecasting future product demand using historical sales data.
- Identifying low-stock items and generating reorder alerts.
- Visualising trends and forecasts in a user-friendly Excel dashboard for decision-making.
